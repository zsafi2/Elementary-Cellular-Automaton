## Project Overview

This project implements the simplest version of a one-dimensional cellular automaton. Cellular automata represent a collection of cells on a specified grid, often referred to as a "world." Each cell in this grid can exist in one of two states: active or inactive (alternatively described as alive or dead, on or off, 1 or 0, etc.). The evolution of the world is governed by rules that dictate how the status of a cell can change over time. These rules typically involve an analysis of the active statuses of the nearest neighbors for each cell.

Cellular automata, under certain world types and rule configurations, can serve as idealized simulations for life. They exhibit periods of determinism interspersed with moments of chaos, creating dynamic and complex patterns. Conway's Game of Life, a well-known two-dimensional cellular automaton, is a prime example of this behavior.

### Conway's Game of Life Example

To illustrate the concepts mentioned above, consider an example world for Conway's Game of Life:
